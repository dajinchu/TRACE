CS5600,CS5600,,"Learned a lot in this class, definitely recommend it!","The professor is extremely friendly and helpful! Always available, knows his stuff and explains things clearly! The only thing I could think of was the midterm, which, in my opinion, was very hard, especially for those we didn't have background before. It would be helpful if we can get a review or get some written homework similar to the exam before actually taking it."

CS5100,CS5100,,Course concepts are interesting. Execution of how the material was taught can be improved.,Course communication was a very weak point. Assignment goals and deadlines were poorly communicated for most of the semester.
CS5310,CS5310,,I think the projects that this course demanded were very good for applying the concepts we were learning about. It might have helped if there were more office hours being offered at different times or with TAs.,"The instructor was very prompt in answering emails with questions, but half the time his reply was not incredibly helpful. He does seem to have very good communication skills but i feel with a subject like computer graphics there should be more stuff being explained on the board rather than presentation slides constantly."
CS5520,CS5520,,The course is spanned over different aspects starting from presentations to paper presentations to practical assignments which I found interesting and challenging.,The instructor taught the course well. He provided the needed feedback and necessary time to complete the assignments. The instructor was ethusiastic that the pupils learn the course work than gain marks which I found very good.

Not great at breaking down code to people who did not understand it."
CS3540,CS3540,,"It is a good portfolio builder, if your goal is to get a job in games.","He understands the purpose of the class, and doesn't demand that students waste their time if they already understand the material for a lecture. Students are responsible for learning what they need to learn, and if they don't need to come to class to do so, they don't have to, but the information is presented in class for any who come."
CS6200,CS6200,,It would be a lot more helpful if the professor can provide the answers to the exams and quiz. I don't care much about the score. I want to learn things by know where I did wrong.,"Personally, I would like to know more about the details of a retrieval model. i.e BM25. I inducted to the final formula step by step from the beginning of the bayes. I hope the professor can spend more time to do the induction to a model mathematically."
CS7400,CS7400,,"PLT-Redex book awful. Cover more PL material and decrease the amount of writing emphasis. Consider more, but slightly easier, assignments (or provide more assistance). This would allow broader learning instead of students getting hung-up on a few hard problems.",Top instructor.

CS2510,CS2510,,"This taught me the basic concepts of how to think as a programmer. It also taught me Java and about interesting data structures. Most of all, it taught me how to approach problems that seem overwhelming at first, and break them down into something I can do.","Best professor I have had so far. I found the honors sections of fundies to be difficult but Prof. Lerner made it challenging in the best kind of way, not too much work, but interesting work. If I had a problem with the material, he was very helpful in office hours. He was always happy to help me out, and is a great lecturer, which made lectures interesting and fun."

CS1800,CS1800,,"The pace of this class is really fine, not too slow or too fast, good for me. On the class, the instructor could ask more questions and let students to answer, which is helpful to mobilize  the enthusiam of students for this class.",
CS2800,CS2800,,"The beginning of the course should be worked on. The course felt like it took forever to actually get going, but at the same time I remember being drowned in buzzwords on the first day. For example, on the first day of the course I heard the word 'ACL2s' numerous times, but the professor never actually explained until later that ACL2s was the theorem proving language we would be using throughout the course. Also, since we just came from fundies 1, I felt a lot of the review of functional programming at the beginning was unnecessary.","Professor Sprague is a nice guy, who is humorous in class and very kind to students, and genuinely tries to help however he can. However, Logic and Comp is not not quite his forte. Oftentimes in class it feels like he is just reading off the lecture notes he is given by the head of the course, and does not actually fundamentally understand some of the material he is teaching. This means that he is more a conduit for the information than someone who provides extra insight into what is being taught."
CS3650,CS3650,,"A lot of C and some MIPS. There are a few things that feel like they don't quite belong in the course, such as Python list comprehension, but otherwise it's a fair introduction to systems.",A lot of time was spent in class giving hints for the homework in reaction to students struggling with it. I felt that time could have been better spent (and perhaps we could have covered more) if Prof. Cooperman covered the techniques that we need for the homeworks BEFORE we start working on it
CS3700,CS3700,,"The course content is really tough... but there's not really any way to make this stuff simpler, it is what it is. Projects I feel like were graded pretty tough, graded on passing test cases instead of code provided... not really sure if there's any alternative though.","Instructor did a good job covering the course concepts, I would recommend the class to someone else."
CS6220,CS6220,,The course covers important topics of the field. The assignments are good and really help to learn the concepts well. The project asked is also very helpful.,I like the teacher very much :)

CS4120,CS4120,,"Very dense, very advanced knowledge, hard to learn it all. I think it might benefit from splitting the Masters and Undergrad level lectures however, lots of the material in class was indecipherable without masters level statistics knowledge.","Very smart, very knowledgeable of the material. Completely incapable of explaining it to students at a level we can understand. I ended up learning more from seeing what we needed to complete the homeworks and googling for information on it. Entire lectures would rely on a stats topic I had never heard of, with only a brief description at the start."
CS4800,CS4800,,Class was very well structured and it teaches you a-lot. It is hard but manageable. I would say one thing that can help the class is having more TA office hours later/earlier in the day and less around the 11am-2pm timeframe as this time is typically preoccupied.,Dr. Ossowski is a very nice and knowledgeable man. He will go over concepts until students understand them. He also is willing to help students outside of class if they are having problems.
CS6020,CS6020,,"I think the class should have stuck with firmer deadlines for weekly assignments (although I took advantage of the flexibility). Also, I think that had the class been smaller, it would have been easier to have discussion.","Some sample answers would have been useful along with the assignment feedback. It took a few assignments to get a feeling for what the graders were looking for, and how to give it to them."

CS5500,CS5500,,This course is not required for the students who have work experience as they are already familiar with all the concepts covered in the class. Definitely this should not be a core course for MS CS.,Mike knows the subject in and out. And he comes down to a student's level and explains some very technical topics in a very simple language. The class is always fun and I always learn something new.
CS6410,CS6410,,"The course is already fairly comprehensive, but learning techniques for compiling functional languages (e.g. closures) would be pretty cool extension.",Prof. Shivers is great.

CS6710,CS6710,,"I enjoyed this course a lot.  I think we did a good job at covering a lot of the different topics that compose wireless networks and infrastructure.  The projects were enjoyable and enabled us to get hands-on experience learning the fundamentals.  I was not a fan of the textbook, I found it to be dry and confusing.","Prof Noubir is a very knowledgable man and comes to class ready to teach and welcomes questions. He actively adjusts the material to cater to student interest, and takes feedback sincerely.  I think class was a but boring at times, but I think that was partly due to the fact that it was such a small class.  I think prof Noubir is great, and would recommend him to my peers."

CS7880,CS7880,,,The course instructor is very patient with students' questions. He is brilliant and nice.
CS6030,CS6030,,,"The lectures tend to be longer than necessary for the material covered. Simple examples get drawn out more than necessary, and more challenging (and important) topics are skipped altogether. There is also no enthusiasm displayed in the lectures, they seem more like a formality than a tool to help students learn, which makes it difficult to watch. It's a shame, because the topics are really interesting and the skills learned in the lectures are very valuable."

CS3800,CS3800,,"I don't think I had enough knowledge coming into the course regarding computation/definition of the word ""machine"" in this class's context for this course, especially at the beginning. As a student that possessed only the knowledge of what the prerequisites for this class and not much extra knowledge regarding computability as a whole, I felt that it was difficult to grasp many of the concepts that were introduced in this course. However, this could just be that anything with theory just tends to be more abstract & require more intuition than other subjects.",He's incredibly enthusiastic about the course and is always more than willing to stop and help a student understand a concept they're not getting. The homeworks are very well made and were a huge part of my learning. He was also quick to respond to questions online out of class. His enthusiasm made what would have been a very boring class much more interesting.
CS4000,CS4000,,"This class is a joke and a complete waste of time. Even with a competent professor, it has no potential to be useful. It should definitely not be a requirement for graduation.",Charlie is great. He's very kind and understanding. Glad I got to have a class with him.

He will point out things that are wrong right away and help us fix it."
CS5002,CS5002,,I highly recommend the instructor to give us more examples.,"Teaching this class was clearly a tertiary (not even secondary) priority for the instructor. Needs to improve returning to the topic at hand--gets sidetracked easily, and for long periods of time."

That's all I can say though the HW assignment can be shorter :) The first half of the course is awesome but the second half is not so much.

Plus the limited time, it's getting harder.","Joe is a new teacher and it shows. He knows CS really well, but his teaching skills are lacking. Part of the reason is that he is not full time, which limits the amount of prep work he can do. He also has a full time job. So it's not his complete fault. However, that is when the TA's need to step in and do more than their job description.

CS4550,CS4550,,"On one hand, this is a good class because I have indeed learned a lot. However, what I learned is quite shallow. My knowledge of the several frameworks used is surface-level, and I could not answer in-depth questions about them and how they work. The error messages I receive constantly make no sense to me at all. The assignment sheets are filled with buggy code, often missing several important syntax marks and having no explanation behind why the example code (supposedly) works. Everything went just so, so, so fast. This should not be a summer course.","While Jose clearly has a lot of knowledge about web development, his ability to communicate that knowledge didn't always shine. Jose's pace was, frankly, breakneck. When he said the course would be hard, I didn't expect it to be THIS hard. I understand that it is his first time teaching the class in the summer semester. However, what I have a harder time understanding is his lack of presence on Piazza (which he promised), his slow responses to any form of contact, and the utterly pitiful grading rate. Again, I understand that it's a fast class. But he said he would be on Piazza 24/7, and I look at Piazza and see nothing but swarms of confused students posting question after question only to be assisted by tentative student responses. Not even the TA's are present. It's hard to ask questions in the class when it's moving so fast. However, I think the greatest issue I had with this class is how easily prior knowledge was shrugged off. I was extremely lucky to have played around with HTML and CSS before this class. The prerequisites didn't quite seem like classes that would have me prepared for this. I barely kept pace. I am concerned about this class because I look at the last homework assignment, which is filled with bugs, and I don't know how to fix it. This is because nothing returns errors. There is nothing for m to work with. All I know is that the more code from the assignment sheets and Piazza I add, the less my code works. This is not a desperate Piazza post here, I am just stating that I don't feel like this class prepared me to do web development. Could I whip up a mediocre web app? Maybe. Could I explain how everything in it worked? Probably not. I whoever is reading this understands that this is not through any lack of effort on my part. I spent more hours working on assignments for this class than I ever have for any class. I'm used to the painstaking process of debugging by now, but I'm not used to teaching myself javascript because this class won't. I'm not used to getting all my help from classmates because of a lack of teacher presence. It is for these reasons that I really did not enjoy this class. I don't feel like I learned as much as I hoped I would. This is not through a lack of effort on Jose's part. However, I think this class should either just not be taught in the summer or should undergo some curriculum changes. I have a lot of respect for Jose for trying to undertake this class, but I feel it was just too much."

The fact that the class average of the Midterm was a 75 and the ""scale"" was 3 points should say it all.  The Midterm questions were too stringent and did not allow for the proper allocation of partial credit.  The fact that this class did not allow for extra credit to help with the poorly scaled final means that those in the ""average"" already had a 93 going into the Final.

There was also a heavy programming assignment towards the end of the semester, however, due to scheduling issues, I felt that the preparation for this assignment could have been better, as the majority of the class struggled. My suggestion for the future would be to provide more material (we had no textbook or links to sources), spend more time explaining the various concepts of the class and break the programming assignment in pieces to be worked throughout the semester.","One of the main positive attributes for the professor would be his outstanding effort to aid students and help them understand the concepts of the class, devoting plenty of office hours throughout the semester, especially to students whose background is not in systems. An area that could be improved is the content of the class.

I think that the lectures done on a blackboard (vs. via PPT) were much more effective because he would work through each step of a problem making it easier to follow complicated solutions. The greatest area of improvement is that he would occasionally get caught-up on a tangent with some obscure math.

Teachers should know better and resist when students ask for something that is not needed in so much depth."
CS5110,CS5110,,"Overall, it's a good course, but I hope we can learn different programming language used in data analysis.",Sometimes i felt the TAs are more prepared than Prof Vitek.
CS5020,CS5020,,"Course covered a lot of linear algebra and probability concepts, along with its applications which will be very helpful for me.","Very kind professor. Gives lot of challenging homework that makes us really understand the subject thoroughly. In addition to teaching the subject, he also gives us a motivation of where these concepts are going to be used. He is also very understanding and sometimes extends the homework deadline without even asking as he knows that the homework was tough. I am very grateful to learn under him."
CS1802,CS1802,,"I think it would be better to have time to review the material instead of just having problems to do each week. The problems took up the entire class time, and sometimes we didn't get to all of them. I feel it would have been more beneficial to spend some of that time reviewing. Also, the seminar was often ahead of the lecture, so some in-class problems covered material we had never seen.","He often came to class late, which caused us to lose time that could have been spent going over material. As a result, the class was often let out late, and he sometimes seemed annoyed when we wanted to go, even though we had other classes after. Also, he never told us when the quizzes were, and I heard from some of my friends in different seminars that they were informed beforehand. I don't think this was fair, as each quiz was like a pop quiz for us while other students had time to prepare and study."

CS5230,CS5230,Medium,"The workload is ok, however, I recommend have better reading materials. The gap between lecture(way less math) and textbook is a little bit big. If there is more reader-friendly textbook, will be much better.","Lecture is good, if we can break a 3-hr lecture to 2 1.5-hr lectures, will be way more better."
CS7810,CS7810,,It would be helpful to provide answer keys or more comprehensive solutions for homework problems. Scribe notes were very helpful as were the homework review sessions.,"Would be great if most of the explanation could also be written on the board, instead of simply verbally communicating them. For students learning this material for the first time, it might be difficult to get the intuition, especially when they are trying to go through their notes remotely."
CS7295,CS7295,The required readings were very helpful but I found the quantity to be somewhat overwhelming.,I would have found it helpful to have more application of the network visualization techniques.,Cody is a good and enthusiastic teacher.
CS4240,CS4240,Materials are super helpful and detailed. Prof. Miller has her slides prepared carefully before coming to class.,"If you want to learn more about bleeding edge technology like spark, kafka, hadoop, etc, take this class. Professor Miller is one of the best professor I've had in NEU. You'll learn a lot by doing homework and projects. Her lectures are easy to understand and detailed. Grades are not main focus of this class, you just need to try your best.","One of the best professor I've had at NEU. Always prepared for lecture, explanatory and helpful with assignments/questions."
CS7140,CS7140,Textbooks are hard to follow for some parts.,,
CS7780,CS7780,The papers were the bread and butter of this class and were great for both my general research literacy as well as understanding wireless technologies.,Analyzing papers was a very useful exercise. The actual write ups were not too long and not tedious like some other classes I have taken.,"Professor Aanjhan is one of the best teachers I've had at Northeastern. He has been able to hit the sweet spot of being interesting, educational, and not tedious."
CS2550,CS2550,The projects were immensely beneficial,,
CS3740,CS3740,I appreciate the professor's attempt to keep the curriculum current and relevant to modern attacks and technologies,"More projects, more exams. Got to the last two weeks of this course with no understanding of how I was standing academically.",Excellent lecturer. Interesting assignments and readings.
CS4620,CS4620,N/A,"This is a research course. It gets messy. It is hard, and it is demanding. However, it gives an invaluable experience in performing actual research and learning new and strange topics.","Its Mattias. He's a hard professor, and asks a lot of his students. However, he's always there to explain something if you need help, and is probably the best professor I've ever had."
CS2001,CS2001,"We mostly just used information/references online, but they helped SO MUCH and are super important to lab.","Lab was so helpful to understanding and succeeding in DS2000. It does not need to be improved (if anything, more class time should be lab).",Professor Hescott does a great job of letting us explore and figure out the lab while also answering our questions and making sure we all understand what we are doing.
CS4170,CS4170,,I've always gained a lot of knowledge after each lecture.,Frequently online and available on slack to answer questions.

CS4501,CS4501,,Please see the trace evals for the CS 4500 02 Software Development class. I strongly believe the project needs rework and I outlined it in my evaluation for that class.,N/a
CS6351,CS6351,"The discussion materials were not always directly applicable to teaching me about research methods relevant to my research, but they usually provided some good insights that might be useful to me in the future.",,The professor was very effective at leading discussions and giving feedback on study designs.
CS7580,CS7580,,"Needs more material than just aws training curriculum. Including Google Cloud and Azure might help. I was also expecting to learn about technical details of Cloud Computing, and not just how to use it.",
CS6620,CS6620,"I think including more basic materials in the lectures are important. For example, Computer Networkings, Systems related topics.","I did learned about how to read papers and write reviews about them. It would have been nice to have more required homework in the beginning of the semester to help us get familiar with OpenStak, OpenShift, etc.","There are few times the lecture were ended early. I think the professors should fill the lecture time with more basic materials. Even just basic/common system admin topics, since we are doing many sys. admin work in the project."
CS5964,CS5964,,Would have really like more time for this project.,Always very nice to talk too!
CS5083,CS5083,Professor was good at solving students doubts and queries,Addition of a simple schedule page covering all deadlines and due dates would make it easier for students,NC
CS5082,CS5082,"Course did not follow any particular text book, all materials were provided by Teacher",Addition of a simple schedule page covering all deadlines and due dates would make it easier for students,NC
CS3000,CS3000,The lectures were directly mapped to readings most of the time but were more concise. I appreciated the effort Prof. Ullman took to post the slides with annotations. Very helpful when my handwriting was messy in my notebook or if I didn't get to write something down. Lecture notes were very very helpful for completing the homework.,I think that the lecture structure with slide annotation being a centerpiece of delivery isn't the best way to explore content,
CS7610,CS7610,The papers are very much helpful.,More guidance for the first assignment would be appreciated.,"Very good job, please keep up the good work!"
CS4420,CS4420,"I think for the beginner in Machine Learning, Bishop' book is better. Although it doesn't cover broader topics like the Murphy's book. It feels the Murphy' book is more suited to people who has Machine Learning background already.",,"I like how the Professor help the students during the office hour. I feel his office hour is valuable. One thing during this office hour is that the Professor can spend too much time in one person, that the next person's need might not be covered."
CS7340,CS7340,"The textbook and most of the papers that we read for the class were very old, so maybe not as relevant in current times.",,
CS4820,CS4820,"Textbooks were good. The last two assignments should have been broken up over 3 or 4, or we should have been given more starter code/guidance.","In addition to the homework assignments given, perhaps several smaller assignments to practice the algorithms from the class. For example, some problems for the students to work through resolution or the FO solver would have been very useful.","I'm a graduating senior, and this was the single most time-consuming class I've ever taken - the weekly homework assignments typically took 10-20 hours to finish. This was the first time the class was offered, and Pete said he'd be looking into ways to adjust it for future semesters, so it may improve in the future, but I would still recommend to only take this class if you have spare time on your hands."
CS6800,CS6800,,"This course is a graduate seminar so it has a slightly different structure. There are no exams and the grade is based entirely upon homework (80%) and your scribe notes (20% - typing up notes for one class). The homework was challenging but very doable. If you need an easier graduate class to take, this is definitely an optimal choice.",Professor Aslam is an excellent professor who is very passionate about the content of the course. He was great at explaining everything and is an overall nice person.
CS6964,CS6964,,"Learnt a lot in industry, both inter-personal and technical. definitely good experience",Effective communication. Her ability to empathize and understand the students problems and concerns is excellent. Also she's very involved in my co-op experience.
