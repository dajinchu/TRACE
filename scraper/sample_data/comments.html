My only suggestion - there were times when the case study discussions took so much time that lecture time may have been short changed.  In one particular instance, this affected my ability to understand the materials needed to do the next case write-up.   But overall, very engaging, interesting, personable, and knowledgeable instructor!</a>

Williams is very engaging and passionate about the material that she is teaching.<br/><br/>Of the three graded assignments due for this class, some students were put at an unfair disadvantage for the first assignment. Prof. Williams split the first assignment by students' last names (e.g., A-L due on 2/12 and M-Z due on 2/19). Key information needed in order do well on the first assignment was not revealed until afterwards, and so, the second group had more exposure to material that would assist them in writing their case assignments. I suggest Prof. Williams has all assignments due at the same time for all students opposed to splitting into 2 groups.</a>
